# Chess Of Pawns
This repository contains the source code of a chess game developed independently during a course at the LMU Munich. 
The program is written in Java and uses the toolkit Swing for the design of the GUI. 
The chess game includes a hotseat mode, the possibility to play against an AI and a network mode. 
For the AI the Minimax algorithm and the weights to be used were specified, but the implementation was done by completely independent work.
